# Round 1

## Algorithm challenge

The first two tradable products are introduced: PEARLS and BANANAS. While the value of the PEARLS has been stable throughout the history of the archipelago, the value of BANANAS has been going up and down over time. Develop your initial trading strategy and write your first Python program to get off to a good start in this world of trading and market making. Even if the price of a product moves very little or in a very unpredictable way, there might still be clever ways to profit if you both buy and sell.

Position limits for the newly introduced products:

- PEARLS: 20
- BANANAS: 20

## Manual challenge

You get the chance to do a series of trades in some foreign island currencies. The first trade is a conversion of your SeaShells into a foreign currency, the last trade is a conversion from a foreign currency into SeaShells. Everything in between is up to you. Give some thought to what series of trades you would like to do, as there might be an opportunity to walk away with more shells than you arrived with.
