# Round 4

## Algorithm challenge

Picnics are all the rage at the moment in the Archipelago, likely owing to the splendid weather. Everyoneâ€™s favorite PICNIC_BASKET is now a tradable product. This classy picnic basket contains three things:

1. a BAGUETTE
2. a nice DIP 
3. a UKULELE for the music
4. a PICNIC_BASKET containing all three

All four of the above products can now also be traded on the island exchange. Are the picnic baskets a bit expensive for you taste? Then perhaps see if you can get the contents directly.

Position limits for the newly introduced products:

- BAGUETTE: 150
- DIP: 300
- UKULELE: 70
- PICNIC_BASKET: 70

## Manual challenge

The latest edition of the island newspaper has just come in, and there are all kinds of headlines. Maybe some of these might offer a nice opportunity to trade on? Get your purse ready and buy or sell yourself some of the stocks that are the talk of the town. Be careful how you allocate your capital though, diversification is typically a good thing in trading. Especially if trading fees get progressively higher, the bigger your position in a single stock!
