# All about Round1 1

Devin the Duck is honoring us with another visit. He is here to buy Pineapples from us, to add to their pizza slices. He will only trade with the 50% lowest offers our archipelago can offer. Devin is willing to pay between 9,000 and 11,000 SeaShells per crate for a total of 300 crates of 4 Pineapples each. He recently traded a single Pineapple for 2,500 SeaShells, so he might keep that in mind as a fair price reference.
Your objective is to set a price per crate for your stock of 300 crates of Pineapples that is within the 50% lowest offers of our archipelago, but above the average price of those offerings. So that if Devin and his fellow ducks realize that Pineapple on pizza is a bad idea and decide to let you buy back your Pineapples, you can make a decent profit.
Note that you can (re)submit new strategies as long as the round is still in progress. As soon as the round ends, the trading strategy that was submitted last will be processed.

Good luck and have fun trading!
