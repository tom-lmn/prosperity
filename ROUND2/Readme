# Round 2

## Algorithm challenge

During this second round of the Prosperity challenge, you again get the chance to trade the same products as in round 1. However, in addition to the existing products two new products are introduced, COCONUTS as well as PINA_COLADAS. The prices of these products fluctuate quite a bit. But might they have something in common?

Position limits for the newly introduced products:

- COCONUTS: 600
- PINA_COLADAS: 300

## Manual challenge

A large group of ducks request a price for your pineapples. They will only buy pineapples at the 50% best prices that they get, so players have to be competitive. However, as the pineapple price is expected to settle at the average price that the ducks bought their pineapples at, you definitely want to make sure that you don’t sell below that price, or you’ll make a loss on your trade.
